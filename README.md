# setup-micromamba

[![CI](https://github.com/mamba-org/setup-micromamba/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mamba-org/setup-micromamba/actions/workflows/test.yml)

GitHub Action to set up the [micromamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#micromamba) package manager.

## Usage

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    init-shell: >-
      bash
      powershell
    cache-environment: true
    post-cleanup: 'all'
- name: Import numpy in micromamba environment (bash)
  run: python -c "import numpy"
  shell: bash -el {0}
- name: Import numpy in micromamba environment (pwsh)
  run: python -c "import numpy"
  shell: pwsh
- name: Run custom command in micromamba environment
  run: pytest --version
  shell: micromamba-shell {0}
```

## Features

To see all available input arguments, see the [`action.yml`](action.yml) file.

### Micromamba version

You can specify the version of micromamba to be installed using the `micromamba-version` input.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v1
  with:
    # Any version from https://github.com/mamba-org/micromamba-releases
    micromamba-version: '1.5.6-0'
```

### Environment creation

`setup-micromamba` allows you to create micromamba environments from an environment file or from a list of packages.
You can use either `environment-file` or `create-args` arguments to specify an environment to be created.
An environment name (other than `base`) must also be specified either in the environment file or via `environment-name`.
If the environment is not fully specified then `setup-micromamba` will skip the environment creation and install only the `micromamba` executable.

After the environment has been created, `setup-micromamba` will write `micromamba activate <env-name>` into the rc file of all shells that are [initialized](#shell-initialization).
This will automatically activate the environment when the shell is started.

#### Create environment from environment file

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
```

#### Create environment from `conda-lock` file

Micromamba supports the `conda-lock` [unified lockfile format](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/output/#unified-lockfile), but this format does not specify an environment name.
Because `setup-micromamba` requires an environment name to be specified, config might look like this:

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: conda-lock.yml
    environment-name: ci
```

> [!NOTE]
> Beware that `micromamba` does not allow additional packages to be installed into a locked environment and will ignore additional specs added by `create-args`, see [mamba#1760](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/issues/1760).

#### Create environment from environment specs

You can specify extra environment specs using the `create-args` input.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    # the create command looks like this:
    # `micromamba create -n test-env python=3.10 numpy`
    environment-name: test-env
    create-args: >-
      python=3.10
      numpy
```

#### Custom arguments

You can specify custom arguments for the `micromamba create` command using the `create-args` input. See `micromamba create --help` for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the same argument as in the [previous example](#create-environment-from-environment-specs) but with different semantics.
> This is because internally, `setup-micromamba` uses the `micromamba create` command to create the environment from the environment file and there, extra specs are specified by adding them as extra arguments to the `micromamba create` command.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    create-args: -v
```

### Shell initialization

In order to be able to activate micromamba environments, you need to initialize your shell.
`setup-micromamba` can create shell initialization scripts for different shells (by calling `micromamba shell init -s <shell>`).
By default, it will create shell initialization scripts for `bash`.
If you want to customize this, you can use the `init-shell` input.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    init-shell: bash
```

In case you don't want to initialize your shell, you can set `init-shell` to `none`.

You can also specify multiple shells by separating them with a space (or using the `>-` YAML block scalar)

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    init-shell: >-
      bash
      powershell
    # or
    init-shell: bash powershell
```

Please read [about login shells](#about-login-shells) for more information about the shell initialization.

### Custom `micromamba-shell` wrapper

`setup-micromamba` will allow you to run commands in the created micromamba environment with a custom shell wrapper. In this &#8220;shell&#8221;, the micromamba is activated and the commands are executed.
With this, you don't need to initialize your shell and activate the environment which may come in handy for self-hosted runners that persist between jobs.
You can set this behavior by specifying the `generate-run-shell` input (defaults to `true`).

> [!NOTE]
> Under the hood, this shell wrapper runs `micromamba run -r <root-prefix-path> -n <env-name> <command>` with `<command>` being a file containing the part that you specify in the `run:` section of your workflow.
> See the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#custom-shell) and [ADR 0277](https://github.com/actions/runner/blob/main/docs/adrs/0277-run-action-shell-options.md) for more information about how the `shell:` input works in GitHub Actions.

> [!WARNING]
> Only available on macOS and Linux.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    generate-run-shell: true
    environment-file: environment.yml
- run: |
    pytest --version
    pytest
  shell: micromamba-shell {0}
```

### Custom `.condarc` file

To specify custom channels or other micromamba settings, you may want to use `.condarc` files to do this.

`setup-micromamba` allows you to specify a custom `.condarc` file using either the `condarc-file` or the `condarc` input.

When you specify `condarc-file`, `setup-micromamba` will use this file for all micromamba commands.

When you specify `condarc`, `setup-micromamba` will create a `.condarc` next to the micromamba binary (to not mess with the `~/.condarc` that may be overwritten on self-hosted runners) and use this file for all micromamba commands.
The action will also set the `CONDARC` environment variable to point to this file.

If nothing is specified, `setup-micromamba` will create a `.condarc` next to the micromamba binary with `conda-forge` as the only channel.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    condarc-file: /path/to/.condarc
```

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    condarc: |
      channels:
        - my-custom-channel
        - conda-forge
        - pytorch
```

### Caching

If you want to cache your micromamba environment or packages, you can do this by setting the `cache-environment` (or `cache-environment-key`) or `cache-downloads` (or `cache-downloads-key`) inputs.

If `cache-environment` is set to `true` and `cache-environment-key` is not specified, `setup-micromamba` will use the default cache key (`micromamba-environment`). Similar behavior applies to `cache-downloads` and `cache-downloads-key`.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the specified cache key is only the prefix of the real cache key.
> `setup-micromamba` will append a hash of the environment file and the `custom-args` as well as the environment name and OS to the cache key.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    # only cache environment
    cache-environment: true
    cache-downloads: false
```

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    # persist only for runs on this commit.
    cache-environment-key: environment-${{ github.sha }}
    cache-downloads-key: downloads-${{ github.sha }}
```

```yml
- name: Get current date
  id: date
  run: echo "date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> "${GITHUB_OUTPUT}"
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    # persist on the same day.
    cache-environment-key: environment-${{ steps.date.outputs.date }}
    cache-downloads-key: downloads-${{ steps.date.outputs.date }}
```

> See [Notes on caching](#notes-on-caching) for more information about caching.

### Debugging

There are two types of debug logging that you can enable.

#### Debug logging of the action

The first one is the debug logging of the action itself.
This can be enabled by running the action with the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` environment variable set to `true`.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba2v2
  env:
    ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

Alternatively, you can enable debug logging for the action by re-running the action in debug mode:

![Re-run in debug mode](.github/assets/enable-debug-logging-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Re-run in debug mode](.github/assets/enable-debug-logging-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

> For more information about debug logging in GitHub Actions, see [the official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging).

#### Debug logging of micromamba

The second type is the debug logging of the micromamba executable.
This can be specified by setting the `log-level` input.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    # supports off, critical, error, warning, info, debug, trace
    log-level: debug
```

If nothing is specified, `setup-micromamba` will default to `warning` or `debug` depending on if [debug logging is enabled for the action](#debug-logging-of-the-action).

### Self-hosted runners

On self-hosted runners, it may happen that some files are persisted between jobs.
This can lead to problems when the next job is run.

#### Post-action cleanup

To avoid persistence between jobs, you can use the `post-cleanup` input to specify the post cleanup behavior of the action (i.e., what happens _after_ all your commands have been executed).

There is a total of 4 options:

- `none`: No cleanup is performed.
- `shell-init`: The shell initialization files are removed by executing `micromamba shell deinit -s <shell>`.
- `environment`: Shell initialization files and the installed environment are removed.
- `all`: Shell initialization files as well as the micromamba root folder and the binary are removed.

If nothing is specified, `setup-micromamba` will default to `shell-init`.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    post-cleanup: environment
```

#### Specify the path of the micromamba binary

You also might want to alter the default micromamba installation location to a temporary location. You can use `micromamba-binary-path: ${{ runner.temp }}/bin/micromamba` to do this.

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    # ${{ runner.temp }}\Scripts\micromamba.exe on Windows
    micromamba-binary-path: ${{ runner.temp }}/bin/micromamba
```

You can control the download behavior of micromamba with the options `download-micromamba` and `micromamba-binary-path`.

| Micromamba on `$PATH` | `download-micromamba` | `micromamba-binary-path` | Behavior                        |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| No             | unset                 | unset                    | Download to default location       |
| No             | unset                 | set                      | Download to specified path         |
| No             | false                 | unset                    | Error                              |
| No             | false                 | set                      | Use binary (absolute path)         |
| No             | true                  | unset                    | Download to default location       |
| No             | true                  | set                      | Download to specified path         |
| Yes            | unset                 | unset                    | Use binary (from PATH)             |
| Yes            | unset                 | set                      | Download to specified path         |
| Yes            | false                 | unset                    | Use binary (from PATH)             |
| Yes            | false                 | set                      | Use binary (specified path)        |
| Yes            | true                  | unset                    | Download to default location       |
| Yes            | true                  | set                      | Download to specified path         |

```yml
- uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v2
  with:
    environment-file: environment.yml
    download-micromamba: false
    # you don't need to specify this if micromamba is already on PATH
    micromamba-binary-path: /usr/local/bin/micromamba
    generate-run-shell: false # this would generate a file next to the micromamba binary
```

## Notes on caching

### Branches have separate caches

Due to a [security limitation of GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache)
any caches created on a branch will not be available on the main/parent branch
after merging. This also applies to PRs.

In contrast, branches *can* use a cache created on the main/parent branch.

## About login shells...

Some shells require special syntax (e.g. `bash -leo pipefail {0}`). You can set this up with the `defaults` option:

```yaml
jobs:
  myjob:
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash -leo pipefail {0}

# or top-level:
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash -leo pipefail {0}
jobs:
  ...
```

Find the reasons below (taken from [setup-miniconda](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda/blob/master/README.md#important)):

- Bash shells do not use `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` so these shells need to be
  explicitly declared as `shell: bash -leo pipefail {0}` on steps that need to be properly
  activated (or use a default shell). This is because bash shells are executed
  with `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}` thus ignoring updated on bash
  profile files made by `micromamba shell init bash`.
- Cmd shells do not run `Autorun` commands so these shells need to be
  explicitly declared as `shell: cmd /C call {0}` on steps that need to be
  properly activated (or use a default shell). This is because cmd shells are
  executed with `%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C "CALL "{0}""` and the `/D` flag
  disabled execution of `Command Processor/Autorun` Windows registry keys, which
  is what `micromamba shell init cmd.exe` sets.

For further information, see
[`jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].shell`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsshell)
and [this thread](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25061).

## Development

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `pnpm install` inside the repository (if you don't have [`pnpm`](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) installed, you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm` or `brew install pnpm`).
3. Run `pnpm run dev` for live transpilation of the TypeScript source code.
4. To test the action, you can run [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) (inside docker) or [`test.sh`](test.sh) (on your local machine).
